* TODO Make a playstation 1 project using that sawtooth detune
* TODO Reset the oscillators when they are stopped. Right now the phasing
  continues even when the key is released
* TODO Capture keyboard to play chords etc
* TODO Side idea: one of those music boxes that reads paper with holes scrolling
  from bottom of screen. Can load, share, save different ones and play some cute
  sine wave plinky plonk sound
* TODO Add background of wavy lines that grow in length with volume
